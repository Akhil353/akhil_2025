# Review of Trimester 1 Work
- Project Overview
   - My group made a project management system that would track the tasks each student in a particular group is working on. The groups were split by table and you could see what each student was working on. 

 - Frontend Features
   - Implemented backend features using fetch commands to display users

 - Backend Features
   - Created the find teams feature (Lets the user see who is at a table)
     - ![Tri 1 Code 2](/akhil_2025/images/tri_review_2.png)
   - Created the update tasks feature (allows for adding tasks to each student)

# Collegeboard Mistakes

### Main Issues
 - Code Simulation (Q22, Q23, Q27, Q30, Q31, Q33-36, Q39, Q40)
   - I had a lot of trouble with running complicated code in my head, often due to not seeing the nuances in the code. For example, in the image below, I didn't understand that it was decrementing the length of the subscript and not increasing, which led me to pick the wrong answer. By taking more time on these questions in the future, I can do better on these types of questions.

 - Properties of Java Data Types (Q4, Q18)
   - Not fully knowing all the properties of the integer type caused me to get 2 questions wrong, as I didn't understand that integer operations result in integer outputs. In the question below, I didn't realize this, causing me to pick the wrong answer. By reviewing the properties of the different data types, I can prevent this in the future.

### Question Corrections
 - Question 4: Selection with variables x and y
   - Original Answer: B (2.3333)
   - Actual Answer: C (2)
   - Reasoning: Since the division operation is occuring between two integers, the output is an integer, and therefore C (2).
 - Question 6: almostEqual method
   - Original Answer: A
   - Actual Answer: E
   - Reasoning: Because I didn't look through all the options thoroughly enough, I missed the correct answer.
 - Question 18: Generate random index for ArrayList
   - Original Answer: C
   - Actual Answer: B
   - Reasoning: I didn't think about the fact that the size of the array was being used, I picked the wrong answer.
 - Question 22: Book and AudioBook classes
   - Original Answer: D
   - Actual Answer: B
   - Reasoning: I didn't look at the setup of the code enough, so I missed an important detail about the classes.
 - Question 23: manipulate method and animals List
   - Original Answer: B
   - Actual Answer: C
   - Reasoning: Because I didn't write out the code properly, I failed to realize that the code would skip over certain elements due to the index jump of 2.
 - Question 31: mystery with 1D integer array
   - Original Answer: E
   - Actual Answer: C
   - Reasoning: I thought that the counter checking would be done before incrementing the operator, but this is done after.
 - Question 35: Print result after a while loop
   - Original Answer: C
   - Actual Answer: E
   - Reasoning: I didn't look at the code enough and I didn't see the *10 operation, which messed me up.
 - Question 39: recur method with int parameter
   - Original Answer: A
   - Actual Answer: C
   - Reasoning: After going through the code, I forgot to multiply the answer by 3 before returning it, so I messed it up.
 - Question 40: whatsItDo with String parameter and substrings
   - Original Answer: A
   - Actual Answer: C
   - Reasoning: I didn't see that the counter was decrementing and not incrementing, so I flipped the order of the outputs and got the question wrong.
