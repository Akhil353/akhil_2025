| Beyond Perfunctory         |   1           |     0.9    |     <img width="555" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-09 at 9 17 04 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3089b67-dfed-4e24-ad75-01afbc33e1aa">  I wanted to show what I learned through a small project that would help me practice all my skills while also being useful. I ended up creating a rudimentary calendar system (debugged using GPT) that would both reinforce my knowledge in topics such as classes and arrays while also being useful for me to organize things such as what I have to do in a specific day or what homework I still have to do. This also worked as a sort of ideation process for me to help me come up with ideas for the Spring Boot Project we are starting to lean towards.   |
