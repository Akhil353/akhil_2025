# Projects

## ScrenQueue
ScreenQueue is a part of the Toolkit system in OpenCodingSociety, making it easy for students to sign-up for assignment presentations and for teachers to go over presentations. The ScreenQueue feature allows students to both queue themselves up for an assignment and present that assignment from their desk using the bult-in screenshare feature.
  - Frontend uses HTML, JS, and CSS to display the queue and the screenshares
  - Backend uses SQlite Database to allow students to sign up by themselves or as a group

## Groups
Groups is another part of the OpenCodingSociety's toolkit system. The Groups feature allows students to make groups, which shows the teacher who is working with who. This allows students to be able to work together and present together while the teacher can keep track of classwork. Groups works with other toolkit features such as ScreenQueue and Assignments to make it convenient for the teacher to assess the group as a whole.
  - Student Groups Management page built with HTML/JS/CSS and Tailwind
  - Teacher Groups Management page built using HTML, MVC, and Bootstrap
