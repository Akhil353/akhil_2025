# Initial Notes

- Be able to communicate and summarize information efficiently
- Be concise with the information you present, don’t jump from topic to topic
- Use Agile Methodology to convey information
- Plan your work to not lose focus on the end goal
- Collaboration requires a lot of planning of how everyone will work together

- A lot of this classwork will be reflected in outside experiences (hackathons, internships, etc.) and without these clear communication/collaboration skills, it will be a lot harder to get work done large-scale

- Comments are a requirement
- Get a better feel for what I like and what I don’t like about CS to figure out what college to go to
- Fully invest myself into CSA so that I can understand how big group projects actually are
- Do college classes that will help me finish college quicker + help me learn about my interests (Linear - Algebra to learn about backpropagation/gradient descent)
- Detach myself from my GPA
- Don’t be a machine for college
- What are my passions?
- How did my non CS experiences build me as a person?

- Start college apps early, don't procrastinate
- Do LeetCode to gain a sense of how to deal with hard coding problems
  - Asked in interviews too

- CS is universally applicable (Physics, Business, etc.)
- Portfolios are really important since they can help go into all the different work you did (Personal Projects, Classes)


# Fixes I can make to achieve my goals
- Collaborate effectively
  - Communicate with others clearer
  - Plan ahead to split up work more efficiently
  - Make sure everyone is on the same page
- Plan better
  - Scheduling & setting deadlines creates a sense of organization
  - Split up work evenly to make everyone work at the same level
  - Diagrams to visualize the workflow and the plan (flowcharts, trees, etc.)
- Understand the importance of the style we practice in CSA
  - Collaborative work is very similar in the workforce
  - Presentation skills of the work you did are needed to convince others you are working & shouldn't be fired
  - High level planning often splits up work in many ways
- Don't be stuck in a college attitude
  - Not everything is about college, your practical skills are more important
  - Practice building my own projects and doing things like LeetCode to build myself as a coder
  - Remember that coding is more universal than just CS
  - Remember to prioritize my passions over how colleges view me

# Student Panel Experience
This panel really helped me see how college students viewed their past and their mistakes. I enjoyed hearing their stories about college and realizing that I'm making the same mistakes they made.
