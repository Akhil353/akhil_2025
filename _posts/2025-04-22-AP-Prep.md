# FRQ Review (2015 FRQ)

### Methods and Control Structures
```java
a. 
public static int arraySum(int[] arr) {
int sum = 0;
for (int i: arr) {
	sum += i;
	}
return sum;
}


b. 
public static int[] rowSums(int[][] arr2D){
int[] arrSum = new int[arr2D.length];
for (int r = 0; r < arr2D.length; r++) {
	arrSum[r] += arraySum(arr2D[r]);
    }
return arrSum;
}

c. 
public static boolean isDiverse(int[][] arr2D) {
    int[] sums = rowSums(arr2D);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < sums.length; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < sums.length; j++) {
            if (sums[i] == sums[j]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;
```


### 
```java
public class HiddenWord {
    private String hiddenWord;
    
    public HiddenWord(String hiddenWord) {
        this.hiddenWord = hiddenWord;
    }
    
    public String getHint(String guess) {
        String[] hint = new String[hiddenWord.length()];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < hiddenWord.length(); i++) {
            if (this.hiddenWord.charAt(i) == guess.charAt(i)) {
                hint[i] = Character.toString(guess.charAt(i));
            }
            else if (this.hiddenWord.contains(Character.toString(guess.charAt(i)))) {
                hint[i] = "+";
            }
            else {
                hint[i] = "*";
            }
        }
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (String character : hint) {
            result.append(character);
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

## Strengths
- **Code setup and execution**: Strong foundation in implementing required methods and classes
- **Java Syntax**: Correctly adhering to Java conventions and proper syntax notation
- **Correct answers**: Accurately answering the question and consistently scoring 90%+ on the FRQ Grading Rubric

## Weaknesses
- **Reading the question fully**: Wasting time by misreading the question and having to redo the question

# MCQ Review

## Strengths
- **Major improvements for code simulation questions**: Better accuracy when doing code simulation questions, along with less time taken for these questions
- **Better accuracy for certain variable type questions**: Improved understanding of how integer operations work

## Weaknesses
- **Integer/Double arithmetic operations**: Challenges with type conversion and precision in calculations (ex. integer operations for variables of double type)
- **Primitive type operations**: Difficulty with understanding proper order of operations and type casting
- **Classes syntax**: What causes errors in classes, what functions work in classes, etc.

# Study Plan for the next 3 weeks
 - Review the Collegeboard Videos for needed topics
   - Integer/Double Operations
   - Classes syntax
   - Primitive Operations
 - Timed Practice for FRQ
   - Goal: 15-20 mins per FRQ
   - Maintain syntax accuracy
 - Review old mistakes
   - Test myself on the questions I got wrong on the Trimester 1 and Trimester 2 MCQ's
